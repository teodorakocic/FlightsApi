# flights_api

The goal of this project was to upgrade my knowledge of Rust programming language by making back-end application while applying the rules of clean coding. flights_api application communicates with MongoDB. By running the application we create two seperate collections for flights and weather conditions. Different queries (CRUD functions) enables getting information from the database.

If you want to run this application localy position yourself in the main folder (flights_api) and run commands respectively: cargo build cargo run

Prerequisite for successfully running this application is to have Rust installation setup and account on MongoDB.
Correctness and tracking the queries is possible by using Postman.
